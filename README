userapt
a simple bash script that installs .deb packages as a local user, no root required (debian, ubuntu and like clones)   

ala:
 $ userapt-get install rtorrent

Motivation: I work on a lot of boxes with uncooperative admins, not always
for sound reasons. 


extremely basic at this point; thinks to work out first:
 1) instead of leaching packages.ubuntu.com for intrepid, use the underlying
apt-get to get package names, dependencies and download urls

 2) dependencies
 
 3) don't double install stuff that's already present system-wide, unless 
forced
 
 4) remove

 5) automatically setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH, CLASSPATH and the like

 6) some basic support for configuration files, please

 7) ...
